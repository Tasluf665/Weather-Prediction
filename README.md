# Big Data Weather Prediction

Welcome to the Big Data Weather Prediction project! This project utilizes a large weather database to predict weather patterns. We leverage the power of Databricks for model development and prediction.

## Project Overview

Weather prediction is a crucial field with wide-ranging applications. In this project, we harness big data and advanced analytics to build predictive models that can forecast weather conditions accurately.

## Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project**: Download the project from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a Databricks Account**: If you don't have a Databricks account, sign up for one. Databricks is a cloud-based big data analytics platform that provides the necessary tools for this project.

3. **Upload the Dataset**: Upload the weather dataset to your Databricks account. Ensure that the dataset is appropriately formatted and accessible within Databricks.

4. **Run the Commands**: Follow the instructions provided in the GitHub project files to execute the necessary commands and run the weather prediction model within Databricks.
